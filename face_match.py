"""
Biometric face-match and liveness.

What this module is for
    Signature verification proves the *document* is authentic. It does not
    prove the person in front of you owns it. A forger who photographs someone
    else's genuine Aadhaar passes every cryptographic check in this app. The
    face-match is what closes that hole, and that pairing is the strongest
    thing in your pitch. Lead with it when a judge asks what makes this
    different: you are verifying issuance *and* binding it to a live presenter.

Non-negotiable from your plan, enforced here
    Compare live, discard immediately, never store biometric data. Concretely:
      - Frames arrive as bytes, live in local variables, and are overwritten
        before the function returns.
      - Temporary files are written into a per-request directory that is
        removed in a `finally` block, because DeepFace's API wants paths.
      - The return value carries a float and a boolean. No embeddings, no
        crops, no file paths. An embedding is biometric data; a 512-float
        vector is not anonymous just because it looks like noise.
      - Nothing from this module is passed to the audit store.

Liveness: read this before you promise anything on stage
    The blink/head-turn check below compares landmark geometry across frames.
    It defeats a printed photo held up to the camera. It does NOT defeat a
    video replay, a phone screen held to the lens, or a deepfake stream, and
    real anti-spoofing needs either depth sensing or a trained PAD model.
    If a judge asks whether your liveness check can be fooled, say yes and name
    the attack. Claiming otherwise in a room that may contain a security
    reviewer is a bad trade for one nod of approval.
